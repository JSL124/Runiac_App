/// Coordinates announcement evaluation, selection, formatting, and speech
/// output for a single run session.
///
/// Snapshot evaluation and bookkeeping (`_previous`/`_consumedIds`) are
/// processed serially through [_tail] so overlapping calls to [onSnapshot]
/// never race each other. Speaking itself is intentionally detached from
/// that serialized queue (see [_speakAndDrain]): TTS wall-clock time must
/// never block evaluating newly-arriving GPS-driven snapshots. Overlap
/// while an utterance is in flight is resolved by enqueueing distinct
/// announcements in a bounded FIFO queue ([_queue]) and draining them, in
/// arrival order, once the current utterance finishes — so multiple
/// announcements that arrive close together all play in order and never
/// overlap. Every in-flight operation is guarded by a session [_generation]
/// counter and a [_stopped] flag so work started by a stale session cannot
/// mutate state after [startSession] or [stopSession] moves on.
