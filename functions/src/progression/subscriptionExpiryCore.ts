// `subscriptionStatus: "premium"` is otherwise permanent once an admin grants
// it: there is no expiry/renewal concept without this sweep. The client-facing
// gate, firestore.rules `isPremiumUser()`, can only compare the stored
// `subscriptionStatus` — it cannot evaluate an expiry instant — so the
// downgrade to `basic` has to be materialised here rather than derived on
// read. This mirrors `isPremiumSubscription()` in `progressionAuditHelpers.ts`,
// which treats a past `subscriptionExpiresAt` as "not premium" for in-request
// XP/leaderboard checks; this sweep is what keeps the stored document
// consistent with that in-request evaluation over time.
//
// Every downgrade appends an `adminAuditLogs` entry (actor "system") so the
// change is traceable the same way admin-driven subscription changes are
// (see website `setUserSubscription` / `appendAuditLog`).
